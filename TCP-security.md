Introduction
-----------

This guide has nothing much todo with AFWall+ itself or it's own configuration, but it can help to protect against known _problems_ and _attacks_ like DNS/DOS/UDP flooding - and they're well tested with Linux Kernels 2.6 up to 4.0, so that's the reason why it's written down here (security everywhere!). These _tweaks_ are based on the articles (designed for a faster broadband) that you can find on the bottom under the ['External Links'](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/TCP-security#useful-links) category. 

Please make a **backup first**, and of course there is **no support** or **guarantee that it works on your system**. If you unsure, simply don't use it, ask your ROM/Kernel developer if it's useful to integrate/use it.

You can use it directly via ADB/Terminal Emulator (busybox sysctl -e -w [_your_param_] script or edit the _/proc/sys/net/ipv4/[param_script]_ directly and native under _system/etc/sysctl.conf_ (same like e.g. FreeBSD) with e.g. EsExplorer.


Ports
------------

On Unix based systems all [well-known ports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers#Well-known_ports) below 1024 (0 - 1023) are protected by the root user account. A full list is (sometimes) available under <code>/etc/services</code> or <code>/system/etc/.*</code>. 

Browsers like Firefox introducing an integrated [blocking](https://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html) mechanism that already blocks all (most) suspect ports by default. Due security reasons it isn't suggest to adjust the <code>network.security.ports.banned</code> function, which allow us to disable a banned port (for whatever reasons e.g. port 87 that unlock the security warning). 


#### Interfaces
Android use the following important interfaces:

<code>Default Route</code> - The special address ::/0 denotes default route in IPv6.

<code>Prefix Documentation</code> - This starts with 2001:0DB8::. It's a /32 range that has been reserved for use in documentation and illustrative examples.

<code>Global Multicast</code> - This starts with FF0E::. It's a /8 range reserved for global multicast's. The _E_ (scope) in FF0E distinguishes global multicast from other types of multicast addresses.

<code>Global Unicast</code> - This starts with 2000::. It's a /3 range. ISPs normally get /32 assigned to them out of these ranges and they in turn out /48, /56 and /64 sub-ranges to their customers. These addresses are globally routable.

<code>IPv4 Compatible</code> - These are special addresses assigned to Ipv6-capable devices, such as 'dual stack' devices that speak both IPv4 and IPv6. They have all zeroes for the middle 16bits - thus, they start off with a string of 96 zeroes, followed by the IPv4 addresses. An example of such an address would be 0:0:0:0:0:0:8.8.4.4 in mixed notation, or in short form, ::A.B.C.D where A.B.C.D is an IPv4 address. The IPv4 portion may be represented in HEX notation e.g. STUV:WXYZ instead of the quad octet notation (A.B.C.D). These are now deprecated in favor of IPv4 mapped addresses.

<code>IPv4 Mapped</code> - These are IPv6 addresses that contain embedded IPv4 addresses (basically IPv4 addresses mapped into the IPv6 address space) and are used for devices that are only IPv4-capable. They have a set of 16 ones, after the initial string of 80 zeroes, and then the IPv4 address. So, if an IPv4 device has the address A.B.C.D, it will be represented as 0:0:0:0:FFFF:A.B.C.D, or in short form as ::FFFF:A.B.C.D. The IPv4 portion may be represented in HEX notation, e.g. STUV:WXYZ instead of the quad octet notation (A.B.C.D). This one if the SIIT (stateless IP / ICMP translation) techniques to enable IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to communicate with each other.

<code>IPv4 Translated</code> - These are IPv6 addresses that contain embedded IPv4 addresses which have been temporarily assigned to IPv6-only hosts to allow them to communicate with IPv4 hosts. This is another SIIT (Stateless IP/ICMP translation) technique which allows IPv6 and IPv4 hosts to talk each other without having to assign both type of addresses to all hosts. These addresses can be represented  by the form ::FFFF:A.B.C.D. The IPv4 portion may be represented in HEX notation, e.g. STUV:WXYZ instead of the quad octet notation (A.B.C.D). This one if the SIIT (stateless IP / ICMP translation) techniques to enable IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to communicate with each other.

<code>ISATAP</code> - Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol is an IPv6 transition mechanism meant to transmit IPv6 packets between 'dual-stack' devices on top of an IPv4 network. The addresses have the form ::0:5EFE:A.B.C.D. where A.B.C.D. is the embedded IPv4 address. The IPv4 portion may be represented in HEX notation like STUV:WXYZ instead of the quad octet A.B.C.D. Depending on the prefix, the ISATAP address can be a link-local, site-local, global or global-6to4 address.

<code>Link Local Multicast</code> - These are a type of multicast IPv6 addresses matching the format FFx2::/16. Here 'FF' denotes a multicast address, '2' gives it Link-Local scope (i.e. nodes on the sane subnet so packets may not be routed) and the 'x' can be zero (denotation that the address is permanently  assigned by IANA and well known) or non-zero denoting a transient multicast address.

<code>Link Local</code> - These addresses match the format FE80:://10 with the tenth bit (scope bit) set to 0 which denotes local scope i.e. they will not be routed outside the local subnet. The possible prefixes are FE8x::, FE9x::, FEAx:: and FEBx::. They are analogous to the IPv4 automatic private IP address or auto-IP range of 169.254.1.ÃŸ-169.254.254.255. They are assigned using stateless addresses auto-configuration procedure and are required for internal functioning of various protocol components before any other mechanism like DHCP is available. These are intended only for communications within the local sub-network and are not routed.

<code>Loopback</code> - The special address ::1/128 in IPv6 is the loopback address which is analogous to 127.0.0.1 in IPv4. The loopback address is an unicast localhost addresses. If an application in a host sends packets to this addresses, the IPv6 stack will loop these packets back on the same virtual interface. 

<code>Multicast</code> - There is no broadcast address in IPv6 but there are various types of multicast address matches the format FFxx::/8. The 'FF' prefix denotes a multicast address (i.e. all bits in bit position 1-8 are ones). There are various sub-types of multicast addresses denotes by their flag bits (bits 9-12) and scope bits (bits 13-16). Flag bits (9-12) denote the nature of the multicast address. If a bit position 12 (Transient  Bit) is 0, then its a well-known address, otherwise it's a transient assignment. Bit positions 9, 10, 11 are unused for now.

<code>NAT64</code> - Is a mechanism to allow IPv6 hosts to communicate with IPv4 server. The NAT64 server is the endpoint for at least one IPv4 address and an IPv6 network segment of 32-bits (64:FF9B::/96). The IPv6 client embeds the IPv4 address it wishes to communicate with using these bits, and sends it's packets to the resulting address. The NAT64 server then creates a NAT-mapping between the IPv6 and the IPv4 address, allowing them to communicate.

<code>Node Local Multicast</code> - Starts with FF01::. It's a /8 range reserved for Node Local Multicast. The '1' (scope) in FF01 distinguishes node local multicast from other types of multicast addresses.

<code>ORCHID</code> - Addresses identified by a prefix of 2001:10::/28 are Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash IDentifies addresses. These addresses are used as identifies and are not routable at the IP layer. Addresses within this block should not appear on the public internet. RFC 4843 provides more information about their purpose and generation.

<code>OSI NSAP mapped</code> - is another IPv6 transition mechanism which has been deprecated. The address block 0200::/7 was defined as an OSI NSAP-mapped prefix set in 1996, but was deprecated in Dec. 2004.

<code>Organization Local Multicast</code> - Starts with FF08::. It's a /8 range reserved for Organization Local multicast. The '8' (scope) in FF08 distinguishes organization local multicast from other types of multicast addresses.

<code>Reserved</code> - These addresses generally start with 00xx::. These belong to a portion of the address space set aside as reserved for various uses by the IEFT, both present and future. Unlike IPv4, which has many small reserved blocks in various locations in the address space, in IPv6 the reserved block is at the top of the address space first 8 bits are zeroes. This represents 1/256 of the total address space. 

<code>Site Local Multicast</code> - ?????

<code>Site Local</code> - These addresses start with FECx::, FEDx::, FEEEx:: or FEFx::. They have their tenth bit set to 1 which denotes scope over the entire site, i.e. they can be routed thought the entire site but not outside. The scope distinguishes them from Link Local addresses. 

<code>Terredo</code> - This is an transition technology that gives full IPv4 connectivity for IPv6-capable hosts which are on the IPv4 Internet but which have no direct native connection to an Ipv6 network. Compared to other similar protocols it's distinguishing feature is that it is able to perform it's function even from behind network address translation (NAT) devices such as home routers. Teredo client IPv6 addressees start with the Teredo prefix 2001:0::/32. The Teredo IPv6 address contains IPv4 server address, obfuscated UDP port number occupying different bit position. This helps Teredo traverse NAT routers.

<code>Transport Relay Translator</code> - This is another IPv4-IPv6 translation mechanism working on the transport layer. A TRT system is installed between IPv6-only hosts and IPv4 hosts and it translates TCP, UDP/IPv6 to TCP, UDP/IPv4 and vice versa. A dummy address prefix of C6::/64 is proposed in RFC 3142 for use in the TRT system. The addresses contain embedded IPv4 address in the last 32 bits.

<code>Unique Local Unicast</code> - These are analogues to private IPv4 address ranges described in RFC 1918. These address prefix is FC00::/7 and the addresses starts with FD00 since the 8th bit or the 'L' bit is always 1 in these addresses (RFC 4193). The algorithmically-derived 48-bit 'Global ID' in bits 9 through 48 is what gives 'uniqueness' to the addresses for a particular site.

<code>Unique Wildcard</code> The special address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 which can also be written in short form as ::. This is generally used as source address in UDP packets during dynamic address configuration. It generally refers to the hosts itself and used when the host does not know it's own address.

<code>6bone</code> - 6bone was once an experimental project used as testbed for IPv6 deployment and testing. It has been decommissioned since 2006 and addresses have been returned to the IANA. 6bone addresses had a orefix of 3FFE::/16.

<code>6in4</code> - This is another transition mechanism for migrating from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to IPv6. 6in4 uses tunneling to encapsulate IPv6  traffic over explicitly-configured IPv4 links as defined in RFC 4213. The 6in4 traffic is sent over the IPv4 Internet inside IPv4  packets whose IP headers have the IP protocol number set to 41. This protocol number is specifically designed for IPv6 encapsulation. There are no special IPv6 addresses associated with 6in4. The RFC specifies discarding of invalid 6in4 packets, i.e. those containing IPv4-mapped., IPv4-compatible, loopback and multicast addresses as their source address. 

<code>6rd</code> - This is a mechanism to facilitate Ipv6 rapid deployment across IPv4 infrastructures of Internet service providers (ISPs). This is improved form of the 6to4 transition mechanism which aims to encourage ISPs to deploy IPv6 to their customers without placing substantial network upgrade requirement on the ISP. RFC 5569 describes 6rd in detail and does not specific a specific address prefix.

<code>6to4</code> - This is another transition mechanism to facilitate migration from IPv4 to IPv6. It allows IPv6 packets to be transmitted over an IPv4 network (generally the IPv4 Internet) without the need to configure explicit tunnels. Special relay servers are also in place that allow 6to4 network to communicate with native IPv6 networks. Most IPv6 networks use autoconfiguration, which requires the last 64 bits for the host.The first 64 bits are the IPv6 prefix. The first 16 bits of the prefix are always 2002:; the next 32 bits are the IPv4 address, and the last 16 bits of the prefix are arbitrarily chosen by the router. Any IPv6 address that begins with the 2002::/16 prefix is known as a 6to4 address. 6to4 does not facilitate interoperation between IPv4-only hosts and IPv6-only hosts. 6to4 is simply a transparent mechanism used as a transport layer between IPv6 nodes. 


Known attacks
------------

These are all (or mostly all) of known possible attacks which is TCP affected by. Most off all kernels and configuration are already hardened by this, but you need to check it manually in the source, via ADB or simply ask your developer if it's included. 

* Desynchronization during connection establishment
* Desynchronization in the middle of a connection
* Fingerprinting
* ICMP attacks
* Nonblind Spoofing
* Routing (RIP) attacks
* DNS attacks such DNS Poisoning and BIND attacks
* Hijacking/Injection of the connection 
* Sequence Guessing
* Replay attacks + Dsniff attacks
* LAN Sniffing (or general packets sniffing)
* Unique Identifiers attacks
* TCP SYN attacks (flooding)
* Denial of Service (DoS)
* IP spoofing
* Smurf attacks
* Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via faked SSL/TLS certificates ([example apps](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit#gid=1053404143) that are still affected)
* Backdoors and side channel attacks on protocol layer or software layer
* 0day
* Authentication and encryption problems
* ....

A very good explanation of all the attacks listed above are on [Peters Smith fantastic article/book](http://linuxbox.co.uk/linux-network-security/) about common Linux security. It's highly recommend to read it, since it's very detailed and good to understand. 

Requirements
------------

As described over [here](http://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml) the following stuff should be _blacklisted_ by default for any vulnerability scanner (and only for them!). These is necessary if you scan your network security against known port scanners like _Nmap_ to get an better result, since it may can display stuff which more confuse you as this shows useful stuff.

* All of the hardening stuff mentioned on this page should be used from advanced users only!
* Time to read this little article + to backup (display current configuration via _sysctl -a_) your existent configuration (just in case something goes wrong) 
* ADB/Terminal Emulator/BusyBox & a **rooted device**
* Kernel/ROM that support these kind of tweaks (if not it doesn't work or is useless)
* init.d support if you like to store these tweaks into a .sh script and apply them at boot (once)
* sysctl support
* A compiled Kernel based on 2.6 up to 4.0+

sysctl
------------

Sysctl is an interface that allows you to make changes to a running Linux kernel. With _/etc/sysctl.conf_ you can configure various Linux networking and system settings.

To load existent settings run:
<code># sysctl -p</code> or better <code>#adb shell su sysctl -p</code> (to avoid some trouble like access denied or xyz is an unknown key [except if your kernel does not support it]). 

To apply all security settings, you need a Kernel which handles sysctl and applies them to <code>/proc</code>. Normally all kernels use that ability by default. If there is no _/etc/sysct.conf_ you can just create them and use a init.d script to apply all included parameters. Or just ask your kernel developer to enable it.

Since the list is huge, here is an [default sysctl on my gist](https://gist.github.com/CHEF-KOCH/0001e66a8c10b1177abe#file-sysctl-conf). 

And a tweaked one with preferred security over speed is also available [here](https://gist.github.com/CHEF-KOCH/0001e66a8c10b1177abe#file-tweaked-sysctl-conf) (needs to be renamed to _sysctl.conf_).


**It's not recommend to apply any debug/memory or other 'performance' tweaks into the sysctl file (use init.d for it) since this could be end-up in a boot-loop. So here are only entries which never cause any problems that can't be fixed very easy by editing the lines as per needs.**

:warning: Do not add any non listed entries in your sysctl.conf - there are a lot of false/myth entries explained on the wild which not work anymore with newer kernels above 2.6+! So, all is already very well explained and which settings are deprecated too - just read the comments! :warning:

IP Rules
------------

Most of the mentioned port's are already supported by AFWall+ and can be controlled directly with the interface (to allow/reject them) but these are normally open (and should be open to avoiding some troubles):

| Rule Name | Status | Range | Protocol | Remote Port | Local Port |
| :--- | :--: | :---: | :--: | :---: | :--: |
| Allow DNS | Allow | All IP packets | UDP | 53 | Any Port |
| Allow Hypertext Transfer | Allow | All IP packets | TCP | 80 | 80 |
| Allow dynamic IP| Allow* | All IP packets | UDP| 67-68 | 67-68 |
| Allow SNMP | Allow* | All IP packets | UDP | Any Port | 162, + ?* |
| Allow Secure Shell/File Transfer Protocl (SSH)| Block* (default disabled) | All IP packets | UDP | 22 | 22 |

| | | | | | |
| A complete | port list| is available  | over | [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers) on  | Wikipedia |

* Depending on which configuration you're on

-> AFWall+ doesn't currently supports ESP, IKE, L2TP, AH and GRE protocols (or any exotic port such QUIC/QOTD) via a gui switch but you can control this via custom scripts/iptables itself.

-> Depending which kernel you use and which configuration it was compiled with, you will see or not see with external tools and commands traffic like IGMP, but you don't need to worry about such stuff. On some configuration it's really necessary, like on [IPv6 systems](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/CustomScripts#important-notes-about-ipv4-and-ipv6-differences).

-> It's not worth to touch any of the mentioned ports, because it doesn't have any notable effect (also no security plus). There are rare situations, mostly only on servers which are compromised by brute force and other attacks (Port 22) but a normal Android client is mostly not affected by this and remember that the port will be automatically closed after the connection is lost/dropped, [it's also a bad idea to put such port to another place](https://www.adayinthelifeof.nl/2012/03/12/why-putting-ssh-on-another-port-than-22-is-bad-idea/). In AFWall+ the whole inbound traffic is by default disabled, means you need to enable the "Allow inbound" option first.

Security testing tools
------------

The term _security tools_ are a bit misleading, the tools doesn't secure anything by itself, but they can display open ports, possible vulnerability's and other threads. Often there are called 'scanners'/'network intrusion detection'/'preventation' or penetration/auditing testing tools which scanning the OS against known security holes or reveal other potential weaknesses. 

There are mostly all **for advances users**, because it need a lot of time, knowledge and tests to really understand them - of course reading is always necessary - but since most of them are well documented it shouldn't be a problem to crow from a beginner to an expert. 

The following list is unsorted and for Windows/Linux/Mac OS/Android systems and may list tools that coasts (_a lot of_) money! Your Av may detect the sites or the tools as insecure/malware in fact they can be used for good/evil!

Some other free boot able LIVE CD's like Kali, Tails, Helix,[...] are Linux distributions that claiming to be more secure and hardened against the known attacks compared to other systems like on Windows (general there is no proof except there words since nobody really can compare Windows <-> Linux on a seriously way). They often already included a huge collection of scanning tools. It's always worth to keep on eye on this, since you don't even need to installing them.

Application Data   <->  <---->    <->    Application Data
```

TLS CAs Theories:
* Root Certification Authority (CA) are based on trust, they promising to e.g. protect against MITM attacks and offering authentications 
* All Browsers and OS by default trust over 100+ organizations, see [here](https://www.eff.org/observatory) and a detailed map is available as .pdf over [here](https://www.eff.org/files/colour_map_of_CAs.pdf)
* If one CA is compromised you get a huge problem since it have access to everything
* 



Addons for Firefox which claim to fix the situation:
* [Perspective](http://perspectives-project.org/) - [Firefox addon](http://perspectives-project.org/firefox/) - Please read the _Known Issues_ on the page before installing it!
* [Convergence](http://convergence.io/) - [Firefox addon](http://convergence.io/releases/firefox/convergence-current.xpi) or as forked _improved_ version over [here](https://github.com/mk-fg/convergence)
* [Certificate Patrol](http://patrol.psyced.org/) - [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/certificate-patrol/) or as alternative [Dane Patrol](https://github.com/hiviah/DanePatrol)


Perspectives:
* Use/search for alternatives auths via PKI
* It's based on _trust on first use_ principle (TOFU)
* Use an SSH trust model
* Unknown keys must be accepted manually by the user
* Keys/Host pairs are cached which doesn't need any interaction (like other addons)
* With every new key the user needs to apply/agree it again 
* Possible MITM - because first use (if it's not from the beginning installed you may already trust a MITM)
* A lot of manual interaction and it's not easy for beginners to see what's secure and what's not
* Compromised Notary-Server is not as bad as a compromised CA
* You can set-up your own Notary-Server, see [here](http://perspectives-project.org/get-involved/)
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Wl2FW2TcA) _BlackHat USA 2011: SSL And The Future Of Authenticity_ 


Convergence:
* Claims to replace completely usage of any external CA
* Personally I would not use this - because it communicate with an external source 
* Based on the _Perspectives_ idea
* Notary are not only limit to certificates, which makes it possible to allow DNSSEC, Content,...
* Notary can interact like a proxy
* User can choose what he trust and what not - _Trust Agility_
* It installs a local CA 
* Unknown (Port, Host names, certificates) are verified by Notary
* Local CA sig. + Cache 
* Browser only see certificates that are marked as trusted by your own local CA 
* [Notary-Protocol explained](https://github.com/moxie0/Convergence/wiki/Notary-Protocol)
* API problem which means it only works on Firefox - a port to other systems is not _easily_ possible


Certificate Patrol / Dane Patrol (or RequestPolicy):
* Certificate Patrol only monitors certificates that have already been accepted by the browser
* Tools like CertPatrol constantly watching for certificate changes by the browser, depending on what was changed you get different warnings
* MITM is still possible because _Trust on first usage_ 
* Possible annoying due the huge effort which is needed to take control over the CAs since e.g. Google and other big ones have different certificates on different servers on their own network - In fact you often gets routed to a different one 
* Tor Browser Bundle have problems with it and [it's not needed](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4064) since it use HTTPS-everywhere observatory 
* Reject the certificate during the handshake of SSL/TLS through POST is a problem especially on banking sites, e.g. if a bank main site is under test.com and the login is posted to anotherpage.com.
* IDN domains are not supported?!
* Possible no autoupdate function (but RequestPolicy does offer such function)
* HTTPS-Everywhere works with Cert Patrol / Dane Patrol / RequestPolicy (but it's not necessary)


On Firefox:
```
security.OCSP.enabled;0 
or under:
Options-> Advanced -> Certificates -> uncheck -> Query OSCP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates
```

Tor Browser Bundle / Orbot:
* Just read the note about Tor and addons, [here](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBOtherExtensions) - or just [visit the Tor Forum](https://tor.stackexchange.com/) to talk about the necessary.



An fantastic article about the Certificates and Public Key pinning is available at [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning) - for certificate transparency information take a ride over [here](http://www.certificate-transparency.org/). Mozilla itself also have special programs and a huge [overview](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Overview) how they handle the policy and included CAs. 

An article which explains a _Life without a CA_ is available over the official [tor project blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/life-without-ca) - [but this doesn't solve all the problems and possible attacks](http://newschoolsecurity.com/2010/03/life-without-certificate-authorities/).

Other _solutions_:
* DNS Certification Authority Authorization ([CAA](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hallambaker-donotissue-03))
* [DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities)
* [HASTLS](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-server-has-tls-04)
* [The Monkeysphere Project](http://web.monkeysphere.info/)
* Use alternatives to [Public Key Pinning Exstention](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-21) or just alternatives like [Track](http://tack.io/)


IPSec
------------

Internet Security (IPsec) was build as a result of the current IP weaknesses - basically it's a own internet layer which claims to be more secure compared to e.g. IPv4 - in fact it was developed around IPv6 (from Internet Engineering Task Force [IETF]), but was engineered to provide security for both IPv4/IPv6. There are some differences in the datagram formats used for AH and ESP depending on whether IPSec is used in IPv4 and IPv6, since the two versions have different datagram formats and addressing. I highlight these differences where appropriate.

Without going deeper these are the main-cores - you often hear:
* Security Parameter Index (SPI)
* Authentication Header (AH)
* Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
* Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
* Security Policy Database (SPD)
* Security Association Database (SAD)
* Security Associations (SA)
* Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)
* ... and [others](http://tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPSecurityIPSecProtocols.htm)
* A full documentation which is quite "easy" to understand for beginners can be found [here](http://www.tech-faq.com/ipsec.html)

Since this is more secure as the good old IPv4 and you maybe have the ability to use it, this should be preferred. AFWall+ does not have any interface to control it (yet), so the only chance is to work with a custom script. See also [#255](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/issues/255) and the official [issue tracker](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/list?can=2&q=IPSEC&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Owner+Summary+Stars&cells=tiles) before you report anything which is already known.

Remember that there is no guarantee since even [IPSec have some weaknesses](http://etutorials.org/Networking/network+security+assessment/Chapter+11.+Assessing+IP+VPN+Services/11.2+Attacking+IPsec+VPNs/).

[OpenSwan](http://www.openswan.org/) is an example implementation of IPSec under Linux. [StrongSwan](http://www.strongswan.org/) does the same and includes support of X.509.

Here is a quick guide:

```
1. Open the Main-Menu
2. Go to "Settings".
3. Open "Wireless & Networks" or "Wireless Controls" depending on your version of Android
4. Select "VPN Settings"
5. Select "Add VPN"
6. Select "Add L2TP/IPSEC PSK VPN" Make sure to select the correct one out of the 4 listed. (NOT L2TP VPN and NOT L2TP/IPSEC CRT VPN)
7. Select "VPN Name" and enter "_<yourownstuff>_" (without quotes) or anything else you want.
8. Select "Set VPN Server" and enter the given server IP Address from your provider.
9. Select Set IPSec pre-shared key and enter the pre-shared key provided to you in the welcome email.
10. L2TP secret & IPSEC identifier remain blank if it's given fill in.
11. Use the 'Menu' button and save the connection.
12. You may be asked to confirm operation with storage password. This is your Android device password!!! Not the VPN password!

13. How to Connect using L2TP IPSEC PSK VPN once configured on Android
- Open the menu and select Settings.
- Select Wireless and Network or Wireless Controls
(depends on your version of Android.)
- Select the VPN configuration you created from the list.
- Enter your username and password.
- Select Remember username and Select Connect

14. How to disconnect using L2TP IPSEC PSK VPN once configured on Android
- Open the menu and choose Settings.
- Select Wireless and Network or Wireless Controls
(depends on your version of Android.)
- Select the VPN configuration from the list.
- Select Disconnect
```

An example IPsec configuration for Windows, Android and Linux can be found over [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/L2TPServer).

The main goal from using IPsec:
* Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks from possible attackers attempting your network
* Encryption, to obfuscate your data packets against [most packet sniffers](https://wiki.wireshark.org/IPsec)
* Protection against data corruption
* Theft of user credentials 
* Denial-of-service (Dos) attacks
* ...

Of course since nothing is perfect there is currently no protection against:
* [Decrypting ESP packets](https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/13022/decrypting-esp-packets-verifying-ipsec-settings) (only with ESP tunnel mode)
* IPsec Replay Attack
* Bypassing Firewall Defenses (well, this affects any OS and any configuration)
* Trusted Man-in-the-Middle Attack
* Stealth DOS Attack (Today usually stronger algorithms are used like TripleDES, AES and HMAC-SHA1)
* ....

Overall there are some weaknesses with the IPsec extensions too but it's still preferred over standard  "non" protected connections even if [NSA's Bullrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullrun_(code_name)) may break it.

Tcpcrypt
------------

The benefit of Tcpcrypt compared to IPsec and others is that this doesn't need any special configuration and the remote end does not need to support any Tcpcrypt extension (ends up with clear text TCP). Like IPsec it supports most common used OS like Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, ... and another benefit [it's overall a bit faster (.pdf)](http://tcpcrypt.org/tcpcrypt-slides.pdf).

Please [see here for an example configuration](https://github.com/scslab/tcpcrypt/blob/master/INSTALL-Linux.markdown) and requirements.

DNS
------------

DNS is known as not secure anymore for several reasons. Like most "secure" communications protocols, it is susceptible to undetectable public-key substitution MITM-attacks an populate examples was the [Apple iMessages security problem](https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/2014/11/update-on-imessages-security/). 

The main problem is the protocol insecurity by [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) and [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509). See also [Certificate Transparency](https://blog.okturtles.com/2015/03/certificate-transparency-on-blockchains/).

The core problems are always:
* [MITM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) (Man-In-The-Middle)
* DNS-based censorship circumvention
* [Domain theft's](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141006/02561228743/5000-domains-seized-based-sealed-court-filing-confused-domain-owners-have-no-idea-why.shtml) ("seizures")
* Certificate revocation
* DOS (Denial-Of-Service) attacks
* Logging 

Blocking DNS isn't possible since this is needed on Android/Windows/Linux/Mac OS or any other OS, but we simply can use secure and proofed alternatives. - Which is more or less less/more complicated and depending on your knowledge about how to change that. 

There are alternatives like:
* Choosing a log free DNS resolver e.g [OpenNIC](https://www.opennicproject.org/)
* DNSSEC/DANE
* OpenDNS (or other providers which claiming to not log/censorship anything)
* DNSCrypt / _TCPCrypt_ (DNSCrypt is now part of [CM 12.1](http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/q/status:open+project:CyanogenMod/android_external_dnscrypt_dnscrypt-proxy+branch:cm-12.1+topic:dnscrypt))
* [TACK](https://lwn.net/Articles/499134/) / [HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning)

But even with such popular alternatives there are several problems, e.g. DNSSEC suffering from miscellaneous leaks mentioned over [here](http://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html) or [here](http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/01/15/against-dnssec/) + it [doesn't prevent MITM attacks](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/).

How do I know if my applications are leaking DNS?
------------

A very detailed answer what DNS (Domain Name System) is can be found over [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/DnsResolver).

There are several ways, the most easiest way is to visit some webpages that automatically detect what is your current DNS, like:
* [DNS Leak Test | dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/)
* [IP Leak Test | ipleak.net](http://ipleak.net/)

If you Browser shows a wrong DNS according to what your own settings telling you, this usually means something is wrong or maybe compromised.

Per-Browser this must be set to get a correct behavior, because they using there own DNS internal settings:
* On Firefox / Firefox Mobile (about:config): _network.dns.disablePrefetch_ needs to be set to _true_.


On the OS level you can:
* Use 3rd Party Local DNS Servers/Resolvers, [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/DnsResolver#Local_DNS_Resolvers).
* Apply Windows Tweak and Registry Hacks, [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/DnsResolver#Tweak_Windows) - on non servers 4 hours is enouth.
* Apply MacOS Tweaks, [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/DnsResolver#Tweak_MacOS).
* Configure Firewall as Fail-safe To Prevent Leaks, [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/DnsResolver#Tweak_Firewalls)
* Generally use [secure alternatives](https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain) + use a [online browser check](https://www.botfrei.de/en/index.html)
* Use always the latest software to ensure possible bugs and security holes are fixed tools like sumo
* Use a secure, user/privacy friendly search engine like DuckDuck, Disconnect or Ixquick. Even better would be an decentralized search like YaCy, FAROO or any other based on P2P/...
* Verify no external addons/software/app leaks something

On Tor your can:
* Read the _Advanced Tor usage_ FAQ section, the two important ones are [this](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WarningsAboutSOCKSandDNSInformationLeaks) and [this](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#SocksAndDNS)

Sometimes these messages may be false alarms. To find out, you should run a packet sniffer on your network interface. The basic command to do this is <code>tcpdump -pni eth0 'port domain'</code>.

If you are using an VPN this also can "fix" the DNS problem, but sometimes even this isn't enouth, especially on Android and OpenVPN, some older versions and provider still suffering from this issue, a workaround can be found over [here](https://gist.github.com/CHEF-KOCH/52fe5cd9a5aa7721fe74).

Another possible problem is that you [ISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) [mitm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) and manipulate the DNS traffic (mostly due censorship or to spoof)! There are only a few methods to bypass this:
* Use [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) + setup it (simply use the setup wizard if you don't know how)
* Use a SSH tunnel
* Choose an VPN which doesn't censorship
* Use [JonDo](https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondo.html) (the proxy) [but browser is also good]
* Use [DNSCrypt](https://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/) or httpsdnsd (HTTPSDNS daemon is already running if you use JonDo)
* For general implementation info about DNS Transport over TCP take a look at [here](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5966.txt)

There are also several tips, tricks and guides directly with a lot of examples over the official Tor Wiki page, see [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/DnsResolver) & [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Preventing_Tor_DNS_Leaks). Remember that the given tricks on this pages are optimized for TOR/I2P, so you may need to adjust some example configuration given from there.

Fingerprinting
------------

AFWall+ or any other Firewall does not protect against the following fingerprint detection mechanism:
* JavaScript link rewriting  / JavaScript Performance Fingerprinting 
* Window Name detection (DCOM identifier storage)
* Headers (referrer, HTTP, agent,... + Timestamps + Timezone leaks)
* LXC-specific leaks
* Operating System Type Fingerprinting
* Keystroke Fingerprinting
* Supercookies (Master/evercookies/HSTS supercookies/Flash) [this is a result because of third-party cookies blocking]
* WebGL / WebRTC
* Display Media information
* Monitor, Widget, and OS Desktop Resolution + Fonts 
* USB Device ID Enumeration
* Invasive Authentication Mechanisms
* Open TCP Port Fingerprinting 
* HTML5 Canvas and Image Extraction
* Flash (Since Android 4.x removed official in Android -> HTML5)
* Plugins intended to be good, but leaking sensitive data (meta,big/small,...) 
* SSL/TLS session resumption, HTTP Keep-Alive and SPDY
* DOM Storage and auth.
* Several bypass xyz settings (like Proxy/VPN/physically access/records,...)

A full overview can be found over [here](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability). A fingerprint test can be found over [here](https://panopticlick.eff.org/about.php).

It's highly recommend to use Tor/Orbot + NoScript (NSA NoScript) + Certificate Control and (if no special about:config is in use) [Random Agent Spoofer](https://github.com/dillbyrne/random-agent-spoofer/).
[HTTPS-Everywhere isn't necessary with the correct Firefox and Tor settings](https://gist.github.com/CHEF-KOCH/b730d9511761e999c9ba) (since HTTPS-Everywhere may break some sites and is already implemented in NoScript [Desktop Version only] or can be managed by the Browser itself).
