:warning: There is no official/inofficial support for Win 10 or iOS, we don't change this to make it compatible because IPtables are for a Linux/Android environment :warning:

Requirements
-------------

* Windows Mobile 10 10.0.10149 (ARM-CPU!)
* iOS (works without ARM-CPU because the objective c code will be re-compiled, so this is a nativ Win 10 app)
* Lumia 635 -> 930 (more soon)
* No Google Play-services integration within the app (not yet? compatible)


Build tools
-------------

* [Windows Bridge for iOS](http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-the-windows-bridge-for-ios/)
* For Android the tools are not yet available, only for a small range of devs  -> _Project Astoria_
