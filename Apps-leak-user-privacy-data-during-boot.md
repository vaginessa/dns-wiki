# Many Android apps leak user privacy data
First this bug is a design hole by Android OS itself and have nothing to do with AFWall+ or any other Firewall itself. 

### What's the issue?
Certain Android applications [#168](http://code.google.com/p/droidwall/issues/detail?id=168), including ones officially bundled with the OS such as Calendar, Contacts and Picasa, send certain data, including authentication tokens (a form of password used to identify a user), in a clear rather than encrypted format. This claim was made by German security researchers Bastian KÃ¶nings, Jens Nickels, and Florian Schaub from the University of Ulm.

### What's the risk?
Think of it like accessing your online banking service via a website that isn't secure. Theoretically, anyone could intercept that unencrypted data as it travels between your computer and the bank's server, stealing your password details or initiating false transactions. 


### Does i have this problem?
You an check this with any [Onavo Count | Monitor Data](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Onavo).

### Data Leakage Prevention / Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

### Temporally workarounds
- Open dialer
- Dial *#*#4636#*#* or *#*#6436#*#*
- Tap _'Phone Information'_
- Press Menu button
- Tap on _'More'_
- Tap _'Disable data connection'_, or _'disable data on boot'_. 

--------------------
For the second Workaround you need init.d support. Ask you ROM/Kernel Developer or see on you readme if you have init.d support or not. Do **NOT** ask on this Github-Repro!
- Open AFWall+ Settings
- Scroll down until you see _'Experimental Preferences'_
- Enable _'Fix Startup Data Leak'_
- On some ROM's you also have to enable _'Fix Device Start Rules'_ e.g. [CyanogenMod 10.1](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/).
