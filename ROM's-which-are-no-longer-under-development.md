Since Android is [suffering from fragmentation problem](http://opensignal.com/reports/2015/08/android-fragmentation/) and we want to keep things as simple as possible, this article is designed to _help_ people with possible AFWall+ problems that are really ROM depended. 

The following ROMs are official/unofficial dead and we not recommend to using them:

* [Paranoid ROM](http://www.paranoidandroid.co/), see statement [here](https://plus.google.com/+AndreSaddler/posts/8ogysnMbwFd)
* [AOKP](https://github.com/AOKP?query=), and see [latest changes](http://gerrit.aokp.co/#/q/status:merged)
* [Replicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicant_(operating_system)), almost [but needs to be confirmed](http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/ReplicantStatus) 


What you can do?
--------------

There are not much things you can do if you not decided to develop your own ROM or want to fix everything yourself. 

* Try to contact the developers first and ask them what's going on to ensure the development not just stooped due vacation or any other things.
* Switch to another ROM or another fork of it (which getting updates regular, which also increase some aspects, like fixes, security, performance, mainstream changes to merge with never Android versions, ...)
* Pickup the source (if possible) and try to fix stuff yourself and share it to the community to get help, feedback and such things.
